# Data collection pipeline

## Note

The current README cache (the `CACHED_READMES` folder) contains the needed
READMEs for the
[`python3k`](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/dataset.html#popular-3k-python)
subgraph. It is a "teaser" subset of the complete graph that I used as a
manageably small (15 GiB) dataset to test the collection pipeline locally.
