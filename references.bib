    abstract="Due to the continuous expansion of the FOSS ecosystem and the introduction of high-quality FOSS, FOSS is increasingly used in consumer electronics (CE) such as smartphones, televisions, and cameras. As a result, manufacturers of CE products have developed a close relationship with the FOSS ecosystem. For CE product manufacturers, efficient adaptation to the FOSS ecosystem has become an essential component in their business operations. This paper will divide the activities of CE product manufacturers within the FOSS ecosystem into the following four levels: identification, adoption, compliance, and contribution. It will examine the main activities and obstacles that arise in each level. The paper will also present instances where companies have succeeded in overcoming these obstacles.",
